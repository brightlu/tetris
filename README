This project is implementing the game Tetris on a Raspberry Pi.
Bright Lu and Sam Herring collaborated in person to develop each file;
exact documentation can be found on GitHub, https://github.com/brightlu/tetris

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game. Various pieces fall onto a grid;
when pieces form a solid horizontal line without gaps, the line clears. 
The objective is to gain points by clearing rows.

Tetris on the Pi can be played by using the joystick and gyroscope. 
The joystick controls movement of the piece left, right, and down.
the gyroscope controls rotation; tilt left and right to rotate pieces.

When a piece locks on the top row, the game ends and returns your score.
